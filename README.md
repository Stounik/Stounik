- 👋 Hi, I’m @Stounik, aka Nikos Stougiannos, I am from Greece and right now, I am writing this personal README file as suggested by Github while I am procrastinating on my project.
- 👀 I’m interested, generally, in Information Technology, Computer Science, Data Science, Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (including the Django framework and pandas, seaborn, folium and scikit-learn libraries) and some stuff about data management and data analysis.
- 💞️ I’m not looking for any collaboration currently. 
- 📫 How to reach me: ✉ nikosst1997@hotmail.com
